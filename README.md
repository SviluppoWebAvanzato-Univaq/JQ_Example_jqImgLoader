# JQ_Example_jqImgLoader
> JQuery example: dynamic image loader

This example shows how to use JQuery to dynamically load web page images when they are about to be shown in the browser window.

## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  [**Sviluppo Web Avanzato course**](https://people.disim.univaq.it/~dellapenna/content.php?page=students). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 24th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

Simply download the code and open the provided html file in your browser.
